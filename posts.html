<h4> <u> An Indepth Review on why Shrek 3 sucks </u> </h4> <br>
<h5>
Shrek 3 is one of the worst movies ever made. It’s so bad I’m pretty sure it soured someone’s life <br>
forever. I was 9 when I was just watching Shrek 2 for the 102nd time, laughing at all the jokes whilst <br>
also appreciating the amazing writing and cast. Then, out of nowhere, Shrek 3 just broke through the <br>
walls and ran to my parents bedroom. Shrek 3 stole my parents from me. I can still remember watching <br>
my parent’s horrified faces as Shrek 3 carried them away with its DVD box-type hands. It shook me. <br> 
<br>
Years later, I married a nice woman and had 3 beautiful children with her. I had a well paying job <br>
with a really nice boss. Things were finally looking up for me. But then Shrek 3 appeared outta nowhere. <br>
It stole and ate my children right in front of me. I could see my parents’ bones right through that DVD <br>
hole. And then my wife divorced me and my boss fired me, because they didn’t wanna associate with me in <br>
case they also get attacked by Shrek 3. <br> 
<br>  
I then lived in a box with nothing much more apart from my copy of Shrek 2, in case Shrek 3 comes back <br>
again. Shrek 3 ruined my childhood, my marriage, my job. Shrek 3 ruined my life. <br> 
<br>  
But then my copy of Shrek 2 came to life and gave me a shitload of money, meaning I could start my own <br>
business. I then got some advice on how to start my own business with zero problems from Shrek 1 and I <br>
got advice on how to extend its longevity from Shrek 4. Thanks to all the GOOD Shrek movies, I now am a <br>
multibillionaire with a loving wife and 2 beautiful children (who are exceptionally smart btw) and I now <br>
own Amazon. I then carried out a very successful assassination on Shrek 3, meaning the evil has finally <br>
died. Thanks to Shrek 1,2, and 4, I became Jeff Bezos. <br>
<br>
Overall Shrek 3 isn’t shrecksy enough and has the least hottest Shrek so 0/10
